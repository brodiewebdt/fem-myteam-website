## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

This was the first site I used a full Git version control workflow with branching and merging. After getting used to it , it made working on the project much easier. Handling fixes to code without breaking the main codebase was a big help.

I wrote a mobile menu from scratch that I can adapt to different projects without to much trouble.

### Continued development

I will be using this workflow moving fowared on all my projects. It makes managing code changes much easier. I want to start using it with React projects as well.
